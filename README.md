# OKBUT.io 🦆

> **Ok, but... hear me out.**

Send hilariously interactive cards that are way more fun than your average birthday message. Because why settle for boring when you can make someone feed a hangry duck to unlock your secret message?

## What is this madness? 🤔

OKBUT.io lets you create personalized interactive cards for your special people. Whether it's an unhinged inside joke, a heartfelt appreciation note, or that confession you've been putting off – we've got templates that'll make your message unforgettable.

Currently featuring:

- **🦆 Hangry Ducky**: Feed the duck the right food or face the quack attack
- **🎫 Scratch-to-reveal lottery style**: Your recipient scratches away digital panels to uncover your hidden message, complete with satisfying scratch animations and victory confetti
- **💻 Terminal hacker challenge**: Turn your recipient into a Hollywood hacker who must type commands and solve puzzles to "decrypt" your secret message
